# VisionBridge-Assistive-Computer-Vision-System
Developed a production-ready prototype for visually impaired assistance, solving real-world challenges in object detection and text extraction.  Engineered a dual-mode OCR system (Tesseract for printed text, TrOCR for handwriting) to handle practical scenarios like reading labels, signs, or documents.
